- Able to navigate through the commands like `cd`, `ls`, etc.  
- Can manipulate files and folders using `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `rename`, and so on.  
- Usage of core concepts of OOPS like **Encapsulation** and **Inheritance**.  
- Can be run in a Bash/Terminal environment.

## Future Plan

Aimed to add more features like `copy`, `move`, and to use other core OOPS concepts like **Polymorphism**.
